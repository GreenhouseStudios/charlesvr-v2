The song is a decidedly sad one. Its text translates: \u201CAbove all regrets, I cry most piteously for my own, heaving sighs piercing my weary heart. Since I have lost my amiable liqueur, I complain and will complain for a long time.\u201D The tone of the four-voice chanson, which is cast in the Dorian mode, matches the regret of the text, with a pervading imitative texture that Gombert thickens in his mass through the use of an additional voice and the continuous movement that Bartoli describes. Though much depends on the interpretation of the work in performance, its overall effect is unmistakably solemn and at least a little sad.
